# Deep Belief Networks

An implementation of a DBN using tensorflow implemented as part of CS 678 Advanced Neural Networks.
I chose to implement this particular model because I was specifically interested in its 
generative capabilities. Starting from randomized input vectors the DBN was able to 
create some quality images, shown below.
